# XGBoost-Ontario-Road-Pavement-Quality
This notebook used eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) on the Pavement condition for provincial highways dataset from the government of Canada (available here: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/01dfc06c-6ef0-4fd0-a010-8ba20e3c9d10). The dataset contains the readings from an Automatic Road Analyzer (ARAN) that was used on various sections of road in Ontario (e.g., freeway, local road, arterial). The goal of this notebook was to determine what features might predict for good or bad quality roads in Ontario.
